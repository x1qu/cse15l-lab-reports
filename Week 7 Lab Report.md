2.Compare two methods
```scp```
It takes me about three minutes. It is a long process since I have to log in and put in the passwords. 

```Vim```
It takes me about two minutes, this saves a lot of time than scp. 

Now I prefer the scp method although it takes me more time, since I am still a bit unfamilar with the vim method. I have to look up the methods. 
Although scp requires logging in, but editing on VS code is easier for me. 

It depends on the assignment, I would use VIM to find or replace words, but if there is more I would use scp on VS code.
